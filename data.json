    "Answer": "Fluorescent tubes contain mercury vapour across which a high p.d. is applied. The high voltage accelerates free electrons. The free electrons collide with the mercury atoms and excites them to a higher energy level. When these electrons relax they lose high energy photons in the UV range. A phosphorous coating on the inside of the tube absorbs these photons, which excites the electrons to a higher energy level. These electrons then relax and release lower energy photons of visible light."

Initially there are lots of electrons, lots of repulsion so electrons leave quickly. As there are now less electrons on the plate, there is less repulsion and so electrons leave the plate at a slower rate. As voltage is proportional to charge it follows the same relationship."

    "Answer": "When a capacitor is uncharged it is initially easy to add electrons onto the first plate (so charge increases quickly). As the first plate is now negative it is harder to add electrons due to the electrostatic repulsion. Electrons are now added but at a slower rate (charge increases but at a slower rate). As voltage is proportional to charge it follows the same relationship."

    "Answer": "If there is relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic field, the free electrons will experience a force (F = BQv), which causes them to move to one end of the conductor. This induces an electromotive force (e.m.f.) across the ends of the conductor."
